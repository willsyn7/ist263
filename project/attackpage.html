<h2>Agencies Involved with the incident</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Bureau of Investigation</li>
    <li>Department of Homeland Security</li>
    <li>Mandiant (cybersecurity firm)</li>
    <li>National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NITA)</li>
    <li>US Department of Justice</li>
    <li>Digital Extortion Task Force</li>
    <li>Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)</li>
    <li> Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</li>
</ul> 
<par>During the attack, a state of emergency was declared by the Biden admisnsaton admist growing concerns about restarting the colonial pipeline. Various government agencies and the cybersecurity firm Mandiant was brought in to consult and formulate a plan to solve the cyberattack. As it would take more then a week to restore operations, the bitcoin ransom was paid and system access was regained. The FBI was able to recover the bitcoin that was paid but the economic damage to the U.S had already been done. </par>
<par>As a result of the damage, the biden administration imptlented polcicies and created teh CISA to incrase the speed at which goveremrnt ageniciesn could resposned to cybersecurity threats. The SBOM was passed during the biden adminsteratoin to bolster cybersecurity and improve analysis.  to The CISA was an agency that starnadrdizied inforimaont security protocotrlls and standards to ensure that firms operating in the United States would not be supssitible to similar attacks.</par>
<par>Since the formation of the CSIA, the orgnziaiotn has set forth various security starnards to protect goveremrnt agcieicns to dfeend critical infastuusture. Large orgnziaiotns are expected to be CSIA certified as well, which has been sucesusffuul. However, modernziaing cyberscurity is a costly endavour and not all orgznaitons are willing to do so.</par>
