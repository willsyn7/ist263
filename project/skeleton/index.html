<h2> Facts on Colonial Pipeline Infastructure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Supplies Jet fuel and disel along the east coast</li>
    <li>Runs from Texas to the port of new York </li>
    <li>Made up of more then 5,5000mi (8,850km)</li>
    <li>Delivers a daily average of 1×108 US gallons (3.8×108 L) of gasoline, home heating oil, aviation fuel and other refined petroleum products to commu nities and businesses throughout the South and Eastern United States.</li>
    <li>Started construction in 1961 and completed in 1962</li>
    <li>Colonial Pipeline Co runs the pipline but ownership is divided between various entities</li>
</ul>
<div class="sec1">
<div><par>Colonial pipeline attack occurred on May 7, 2021, one of the most devastating cyberattacks on U.S infrastructure. It was one of the many attacks launched by Russian cybercriminals in 2020 and 2021. </div>
<div>The attack was launched by the hacker group Darkside and resulted in the shutting down of Colonial Pipeline operations. Darkside has previously attacked Canadian transportation infrastructure and IT services across North America.</par></div>
</div> The attack targeted the computer systems of Colonial Pipeline Co. to prevent transactions from occurring. The hackers gained access to the system through an employee's compromised password</div>
<div>The employee had used the same password on the same account, thus resulting in a compromised system.</div>
<div>

<div class="sec2">
<div><par>After gaining access to the system Darkside installed $4.4million in Bitcoin in exchange for a decryption key.The halting of daily operations had a vast impact on Colonial Co.'s financials and also led to a rise in fuel along the East Coast. </div>
<div>Due to the severity of the cyber attack on U.S. infrastructure, a fast response by the government occurred that would set the foundations for cybersecurity protocols and organizations not only in the United States but internationally.</div>
</par>
</div>


<div class="sec3">
    <div><par> After the attack Colonial Piple Co. was in contact wtih various govemrent agenceis and a prviate cyber security firm to restore access and recieve consultation on the best avaiable coruse of action.</div>
    <div> Analyst drew a conclsuion that it would take too long to restore opreations, as the colonial pipeline was a vital part of East Coast infastructure. </div>
    <div> Thus, the ransom was paid and operations was restored on May 12th 2021, five days after the attack had begun. </div>
