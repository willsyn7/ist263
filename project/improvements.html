<h2> Cybersecurity Measures</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Cyberseuricvty Preventive measures </li>
    <li>CISA standards implemented</li>
    <li>Use multi factor authieticaoin </li>
    <li> Limit access of lower level employees</li>
    <li>Use 2 or more security keys when making changes  </li>
</ul>
<div class="sec1">
    <div><par>The government could have done more to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. </div>
    <div>One of these is tying direct financial benefits to improving cyber security. Despite CISA verification, the cost of implanting modern IT security protocols</div>
    <div>and standards can be costly. Thus, instead of expecting companies to implement IT security standards they could financially incentivize them by maybe </div>
    <div>offering financial instances in implementing security policies or rewarding them with incentives when certain levels are reached. </par></div>
</div> 

<div class="sec2"></div>
<div><par>In addition, since the security risk that was exploited was a data leak where the employee used the same password, the government could require</div>
<div>multifactor authentication, the use of multiple security keys, and complex strong passwords when handing out government tenders to organizations. </par></div>


 
<div class="sec3">
<div><par>At an enterprise level, various security policies could have been implemented by Colonial Pipeline company to prevent such an attack. </div>
<div>For starters, they could have required all employees to have 2-factor authentication when signing.  In addition, when making large changes to the </div>
<div>financial system or operations, they could require one more security key, thus resulting in at least two users being compromised for large damage to be/div>
<div>done. However, by having regular education seminars on data leaks and cyber security threats for government subsidiaries and private companies, risk can be mitigated as well.</par>
